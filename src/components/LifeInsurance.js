            <p><strong>Life Insurance</strong><br />
            Most individuals purchase life insurance with their loved ones and beneficiaries in mind. Some life insurance policies can be used toward “living benefits,” where the company will buy back the policy for around 50-70% of its value. Some policies will not offer “living benefits” unless the policyholder is terminally ill. If your policy does not allow for this accelerated benefit, you can sell your policy to a third-party company in return for what is called “life settlement,” which also typically is 50-75% of the face value. After the policy has been purchased, the third-party company is responsible for the payments and receives the full value once the original policyholder passes away.</p>
            <p>One other option to review with your insurance company is “life assurance benefit” or “life insurance conversion program.” The policyholder can convert their policy benefits into long-term care payments. This option typically pays 15-50% of the value and is available for policies that don’t qualify for “life settlement.”</p>
            <p><strong>Reverse Mortgage</strong><br />
            Does your parent own their home, or are they close to paying it off? A reverse mortgage may be a solution. It allows you to cash out the value of the equity that you have in the home. The bank may pay in full or over a series of monthly payments. The borrower can stay in the home until they pass away when the loan needs to be repaid in full, which often requires selling the home. This can be a good solution if one parent needs assisted living or memory care, and the other parent can then remain in the house. To qualify, the homeowner needs to be at least age 62 and will continue to live in the home. A reverse mortgage is not for everyone—so research the pros and cons and work with a reputable company to make an informed decision for your family.</p>
            <p><strong>Selling or Renting a Home</strong><br />
            Your parent’s home may be an asset to sell or rent. You can either use the rental income or home sale to pay for senior care. Some may not be ready to make a hasty decision to sell a family home, and others may not want to be landlords, so you will need to make a decision that works best for your family. Consider using an outside company to manage the rental to ease the burden of dealing with renters.</p>
            <p>If your family is facing the reality that it is no longer safe or healthy for your parent to live on their own, then you will need to make some important decisions about their future. Of course, you want what is best for your parent, but these care options come with costs. We believe the best strategy is to plan early so your family isn’t making these decisions during an emergency. If you have the time to research your options and compare costs, then you can make a more well-informed decision. Early planning can get everyone on the same page to make a realistic budget to work with going forward and will better inform the types of services and communities you should be touring. Money can be a touchy subject and difficult to address. Opening the lines of communication and planning early can alleviate some of this stress.</p>
