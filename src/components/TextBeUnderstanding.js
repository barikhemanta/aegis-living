            <p>How receptive is your parent when speaking about their living situation, limitations, and lifestyle? When you sit down to start the conversation, remember moving may be overwhelming and uncomfortable for your parent.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Be understanding</strong><br />Your parent may be worried about losing their independence or nervous about starting over in a new place or simply in denial. Be patient and listen to their concerns as you work through this transition together.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Be clear</strong><br />Your parent might feel like a burden or believe that itâ€™s more practical to stay in their home. However, staying in your childhood home may cause your family more time, money, and stress to accommodate their changing needs. Be kind, but clear about their current living situation and your concerns for their wellbeing.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Decide as a family</strong><br />Be prepared that moving your parent can be charged with feelings of guilt and denial, making the process difficult. If your parent has a living spouse, the decision can be particularly sensitive and more complicated. Be gentle with each other through this process, focusing on what is best for your loved one.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Be involved in the process</strong><br />View communities online together and request brochures for review. Find out what is most important in a community (food, activities, amenities, staff), so they are happy and comfortable. Making your parent a part of the process will help your family find the best fit.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Take a tour</strong><br />The best way for your parent to understand how a community feels and the advantages that it will offer is to schedule a tour. Your parent can meet the staff and other residents, taste the cuisine, tour an apartment, stay for an activity, and get a sense of what it would be like to live there.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Have an ongoing conversation</strong><br />Start the discussion about long-term care much earlier than you may think. If your parent is resistant, a single conversation may feel like a confrontation. Take your time and break up the conversation if it feels tense.</p>
