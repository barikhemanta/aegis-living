            <p>Moving into an assisted living or memory care community comes with many benefits for the resident’s lifestyle and health. Residents can live as independently as possible with support and care.</p>
            <p><strong>Not an “Old folks’ home.”</strong>Many parents and elderly loved ones have outdated opinions about assisted living. The industry has evolved dramatically over the last few decades. Your parent may not be fully aware of the options that are available to enhance their quality of life.</p>
            <p><strong>New friends.</strong>Communities center around social interaction with communal dining, engaging group activities, and plenty of open space to chat with neighbors and make new friends.</p>
            <p><strong>Distinctive amenities.</strong>The variety of amenities offered in different communities will vary. From movie theaters to demonstration kitchens, from swimming pools to pool tables, or tearooms to teacup poodles, find the community that has features to fit your parent’s personality and preferences.</p>
            <p><strong>Activities schedule.</strong>At Aegis Living, our Life Enrichment directors plan a full calendar of rotating daily events and activities to entertain and engage our residents. When touring a community, inquire about the variety of events and activities, and ask to see the calendar.</p>
            <p><strong>24/7 care staff.</strong>Around-the-clock care staff provides support to meet the personal and medical needs of the residents. The specially trained staff understands the unique needs of the elderly and how to care for residents with dignity.</p>
            <p><strong>Peace of mind.</strong>Families spend so much time, energy, and stress worrying about a parent’s health and safety living at home. Moving your parent into an assisted living or memory care community can provide significant relief and peace of mind.</p>
