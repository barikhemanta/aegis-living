          <p>To meet the needs of today’s retirees, the senior housing industry is preparing for a greater diversity of lifestyles, ethnicities, religions, and backgrounds. Every senior housing option should be inclusive and welcoming to all seniors. But we encourage you to shop around for a community that is comfortable for your parent. Don’t be afraid to ask questions about cultural sensitivity, dietary restrictions, and specific diets due to religious beliefs.</p>
            <p>Some senior housing companies are creating affinity senior living communities—niche communities that cater to specific groups. LGBTQ communities offer welcoming senior housing homes and communities that are discrimination-free and supportive. Immigrant families are finding assisted living and memory care communities that cater to specific cultures, such as Asian or Indian, or faith-based communities. These culturally authentic communities offer curated interior décor, traditional cuisine, familiar activities, and multilingual care staff ensures that residents are clearly understood and able to express their needs. These carefully selected details, from the food to the décor and dress, give residents a sense of belonging.</p>
            <p>Other lifestyle needs may be smaller, but just as important. Some people feel that a house isn’t a home without a beloved pet. If your parent has a pet that they cherish, make sure they can stay together in their new home. Or look for a community with a lovable house pet to share.</p>
            <p>Perhaps your parent is an avid gardener, movie buff, foodie, bridge player, voracious reader, or exercise enthusiast, these hobbies and interests can be met by communities if you ask the right questions. Do they have a private movie theater, exercise room, book club, or garden? And what kind of access or involvement can they have in these hobbies while living in the community? Find a community that encourages them to continue to do what they love most.
            </p>
            <p>Whatever their interest, background, ethnicity, or lifestyle, everyone wants to feel like they belong. Maintaining their lifestyle, with some assistance, can help your parent thrive in a new home.</p>
